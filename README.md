# Python Projects

I'm gonna use this repository to store my python projects and to help me keep track of my studies.

The book that I'm following is called "The Big Book of Small Python Projects". There's actually two reasons for that:

1. Is the one I've been recommended the most

2. It focuses on improving your problem-solving skills and logical thinking rather than teach you step by step how to do it. Also it gives you several challenges and lots of questions to test your understanding of the solution, such as "Why did that happen?" or "If we change this for that, does it still work?"
