## Bagel, a deductive logic game

Let's play a game. I'll think of a number and you need to guess it based on some clues.

Here's the rules:

1) It's a 3 digit number
2) You have a maximun of 10 guesses
3) I'll give you a clue based on how close you got from my number. The clues are:
- Pico: One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
- Fermi: One digit is correct and in the right position.
- Bagels: No digit is correct.

For example:

Number: 248
Guess: 843

My clues will be: Fermi Pico. This means that one number is in the right place and is a correct value (Fermi, 4), and there's another digit that is in the incorrect place, but it's one correct value (Pico, 8).
